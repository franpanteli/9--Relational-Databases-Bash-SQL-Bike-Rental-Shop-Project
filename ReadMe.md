# Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my ninth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-bash-and-sql-by-building-a-bike-rental-shop/build-a-bike-rental-shop) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my shell scripting skills with Bash and SQL. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/9--Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the ninth of these projects completed as part of this.

## Problem Solving
For this project, I had to complete 210 Bash and SQL lessons. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/9--Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). A shell script was created for this project, which contained a program for a bike shop rental company. This stored customer information in an SQL database, to allow users to rent and return bikes.

## Solution Workflow 
- To solve this problem, I first cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment and followed 210 Bash and SQL lessons. The [in-depth notes I produced from completing this are here](https://github.com/franpanteli/9--Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-bash-sql-bike-rental-shop-project-course-notes.txt)
- SQL commands were inserted into the project [`bike-shop.sh`](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/bike-shop.sh) file, to query its database. These SQL commands were first written by trialling them in a psql prompt 
- An executable file permission was added to the project shell file. A shebang line was added to the top of this so that it was interpreted with Bash. This was then tested by running the project in a Bash terminal, by using `./bike-shop.sh` 
- This process was repeated until a program was produced that allowed users to borrow and return bikes from a rental shop, according to their phone number and name in its database
- The specific commands used throughout this process are found in the project notes. These are in-depth and [found here](https://github.com/franpanteli/9--Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-bash-sql-bike-rental-shop-project-course-notes.txt)
