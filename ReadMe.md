# INSERT_REPO_TITLE
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my INSERT'TH project](INSERT_PROJECT_LINK) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my INSERT_E.G_SQL,SHELL,SCRIPTING and INSERT skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](INSERT_LINK). This repository is for the INSERT'TH of these projects I completed as part of this.
