# Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my ninth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-bash-and-sql-by-building-a-bike-rental-shop/build-a-bike-rental-shop) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my INSERT_E.G_SQL,SHELL,SCRIPTING and INSERT skills. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/9--Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the ninth of these projects I completed as part of this.
