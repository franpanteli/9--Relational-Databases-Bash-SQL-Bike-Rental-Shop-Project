# Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project
## Relational Databases Independent Learning
I independently completed [my ninth project](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/learn-bash-and-sql-by-building-a-bike-rental-shop/build-a-bike-rental-shop) in freeCodeCamp's [Relational Databases course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) to improve my shell scripting skills with Bash and SQL. This curriculum consisted of 14 guided projects, to be completed in a Gitpod environment. My notes outlining the names (et al) of these guided projects are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/9--Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/0%20relational-databases-course-overview.txt). This repository is for the ninth of these projects I completed as part of this.

## Problem Solving
For this project, I had to complete 210 Bash and SQL lessons. My notes on the full task brief for this are [here](https://github.com/franpanteli/9--Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/1%20project-task-notes.txt). A shell script was created for this which contained an application for a bike shop rental company. This allowed users to rent and return bikes and stored their information in an SQL database. 

## Solution Workflow 
- To solve this problem, I first cloned the project boilerplate files in a Gitpod environment and followed its 210 Bash and SQL lessons. The [in-depth notes I produced when completing this are here](https://github.com/franpanteli/9--Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-bash-sql-bike-rental-shop-project-course-notes.txt)
- I queried the project database in a Gitpod environment, by first writing SQL commands in a PSQL prompt. When the SQL which produced the desired output was obtained, it was inserted into the project [`bike-shop.sh`](https://github.com/franpanteli/Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/bike-shop.sh) shell file
- Executable file permissions were added to this shell file. A shebang line was added so that this was interpreted with Bash. The project was then tested by running it in a Bash terminal, with `./bike-shop.sh` 
- This process was repeated until a program was produced which allowed users to borrow and return bikes from a rental shop, according to their unique phone number and name in its database
- More information about the specific commands used as part of this is in the project notes. These are in-depth and [found here](https://github.com/franpanteli/9--Relational-Databases-Bash-SQL-Bike-Rental-Shop-Project/blob/main/2%20relational-databases-bash-sql-bike-rental-shop-project-course-notes.txt)
